Details Motor Shaft Preparation
=======================

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_18.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Motor Shaft Assembly.*

Description
------------
The aluminum motor pulley and the stainless steel motor shaft have to be bonded with Loctite 648.  
There is a 3d printed tool that helps with positioning the motor pulley correctly.   
The code wheel is bonded to the code wheel mount with superglue (Loctite 406).  
Step by step instructions below.

Step 1 - Pulley Bonding
---------------

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_1.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Motor shaft, motor timing belt pulley and tool for motor shaft bonding.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_1.png" width="400"> <br>*Make sure that the tool supports the pulley in the right position before bonding.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_2.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Clean the surfaces with ethanol and apply some Locitite 648.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_3.jpg" width="320"> <br>*Insert the motor shaft into the pulley and remove excess Loctite with a q-tip. <br>Make sure that the flat on the motor shaft is pointing upwards.<br>Place the parts on the 3d printed tool and let them cure at room temperature for a couple of hours.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_4.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Put the parts with the tool in an oven and cure another couple of hours for full strength.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_5.jpg" width="400"> <br>*We cure the parts at 70 degrees Celcius.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_6.jpg" width="400"> <br>*The motor shaft and pulley assembly is now ready and can be used for the next step.*

Step 2 - Code Wheel Bonding
----------------------------
<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_9.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Motor shaft with pulley, code wheel, code wheel mount and bonding tool.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_7.jpg" width="400"> <br>*There are different sources for the code wheel. <br> Left side- printed code wheel / Right side - code wheel from encoder kit. <br> Make sure to use the corresponding code wheel mount stl file. <br> All the other assembly steps are identical.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_8.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Place the code wheel on the code wheel mount and make sure it fits before you apply glue. <br> Make sure that the code wheel is fully seated, flat and doesn't wobble when you turn it.*

**Important: The code wheel has to be mounted in the correct orientation.<br> The print on the code wheel has to be readable from the top as shown in the picture.**

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_10.jpg" width="400"> <br>*I find it easiest to bond the code wheel on the stator. <br> Insert the motor shaft with the flats downwards into the bearings of the stator.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_12.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Place the code wheel mount on the motor shaft and push it all the way down. <br> Make sure that the teeth of the pulley engage with the mount*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_11.jpg" width="400"> <br>*If the code wheel mount too tight you can adjust the diameter with a 4mm reamer.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_13.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Prepare your code wheel with the print facing upwards. <br> Prepare the superglue, tooth pick, q-tipps and the bonding tool.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_14.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Apply a thin layer of Loctite to the code wheel mount.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_15.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Place the code wheel on the mount and push it all the way down using the tool.<br> Hold for 30 seconds and wait a couple of minutes for the glue to cure.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_16.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Code wheel bonded to the code wheel mount.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_17.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Rotate the motor shaft and make sure that the code wheel is horizontal and doesn't wobble.<br> Remove the motor shaft assembly from the stator.*

<img src="../images/motor_shaft_preparation_18.jpg" width="400"> <br>*The motor shaft assembly is now ready for installation.*
