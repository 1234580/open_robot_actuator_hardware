Details Encoder and Codewheel
=======================

<img src="../images/broadcom_encoder_1.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Encoder and Codewheel from Encoder Kit AEDM-5810-Z12*  

Description
------------
For some reason the codewheels with lower resolution are available but it's difficult to source the highest resolution 5000cpr codewheels for the encoder.

There are two different options that we have found so far:
* You can either order the AEDM-5810-Z12 encoder kit that consists of the encoder and the 5000cpr codewheel attached to a aluminum mount. (Option A - below)  
* Or you can order the Broadcom AEDT-9810-Z00 encoder without the codewheel and have the codewheel manufactured. (Option B - below)

### Option A - Encoder Kit

#### Instructions:
* Find and order the AEDM-5810-Z12 encoder kit
* Disassemble the encoder kit and extract the encoder and the codewheel
* Modify the aluminium flange according to [this drawing](../drawings/codewheel_modification.pdf)
* Use the correct stl to print encoder mount (the encoder mounts for the two options are different)


### Option B - Codewheel Fabrication

### Instructions:

* Sources for ordering the codewheels will follow...
