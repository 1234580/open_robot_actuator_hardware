<img src="../details/motor_mod_1_1.jpg" width="400"> <br>*Stator and rotor separated and prepared for installation*

## Separating Rotor and Stator
<img src="../details/motor_mod_2.jpg" width="250"> <br>*Bottom view: the retaining ring holds the motor shaft in place*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_2_1.jpg" width="250"> <br>*Remove the retaining ring from the motor shaft.<br>
Don't worry about damaging the retaining ring - it's no longer needed*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Separate the rotor from the stator by pulling gently to overcome the magnetic forces.. <br>Make sure to keep the brass washer. Store the rotor on a clean surface. <br>Metal particles will stick to the magnets and can cause problems later.*

## Rotor Preparation
<img src="../details/motor_mod_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Remove the two M3 set screws on the rotor using a 1,5mm hex driver.<br>Keep the set screws for reassembly.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_10.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Place the rotor on the 3d printed "motor shaft extraction tool".<br>[STL file Motor Shaft Extraction Tool](../stl_files/tool_motor_shaft_extraction.STL)*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_5.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use a hammer and a pin driver to remove the motor shaft.*  
<img src="../details/motor_mod_6.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Rotor with motor shaft removed.*  

<img src="../details/reamers_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*You will now need different reamer sizes to increase the bore diameter of the rotor.<br>We use 3 different reamers with 3.98mm, 3.99mm and 4.00mm diameter.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_11.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use a tool holder to manually increase the bore diameter.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_12.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Start with the smallest reamer - 3.98mm.<br>Put some oil on the reamer. <br>Carefully insert and turn the reamer a couple of times.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_13.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Put a bit of oil on the custom motor shaft.[ -> PDF drawing](../drawings/motor_shaft.PDF)*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_14.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Try to insert the custom motor shaft. <br> If the reamed hole is too tight repeat the last two steps with the same reamer size.<br> If the bore is still too tight use the next larger reamer size. <br> Continue until the shaft can be installed and removed with moderate force.*

**Important:** Be careful not to increase the bore diameter too much.  
If the fit is too loose the rotor will wobble when spinning.

<img src="../details/motor_mod_16.jpg" width="300"> <br>*The rotor is now ready for assembly.*

# Stator Preparation
<img src="../details/motor_mod_7.jpg" width="300"> <br>*T-Motor has changed the insulation on the phase wires.<br>
Now the insulation is too thick to pass through the structure and has to be removed.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_7_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Carefully cut and remove the large heat shrink at the base.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_7_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Cut off a piece of the phase wire heat shrink under an angle.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_7_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Hold the phase wire with pliers and grab the heat shrink with your fingers.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_7_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Slowly pull on the wire while holding the heat shrink.<br>The wire will cut through the heat shrink. <br>Continue until the insulation is removed half way.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8.jpg" width="300"> <br>*You should now be able to carefully pull off the heat shrink from the phase wires.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*We shorten the motor phase wires to about 2,5cm measured from the base of the stator.<br>This helps to keep the solder connection inside of the shell structure.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*We use a temperature controlled soldering iron to burn off the orange insulation.<br>Set your soldering iron to a temperature of abour 400 degrees celcius.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Put solder on the tip and heat up the ends of the phase wires.<br>Wait until the insulation disappears and you can see 5mm of silver wire exposed.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*The insulation is removed from the ends of the phase wires.<br>You can now solder the extension wires.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_5.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Reduce the soldering temperature to about 300 degrees celcius.<br>Solder extension wires to the phase wires.<br>We use LiY wire with a cross section of 0,5mm<sup> 2</sup>.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_6.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Prepare the heat shrink for insulating the wires.<br>Try to keep the heat shrink short.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_8_7.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use a heat gun to apply the heat shrink.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_9.jpg" width="300"> <br>*If you are unsure about the correct wire length you can stop here.<br>Follow all the other preparation steps and fully assemble the actuator module.<br>You can then determine the correct wire length and solder the connectors later.*  

<img src="../details/motor_mod_9_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*If you know the required wire length cut the wires accordingly.<br>Remove a bit of the insulation, twist the strands and apply solder.*

<img src="../details/motor_connectors_1.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Prepare the male motor phase connectors.<br> We are using the 2mm gold connectors from REELY*

<img src="../details/motor_connectors_2.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Solder the connectors onto the phase wires.*

<img src="../details/motor_connectors_3.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Use heat shring to insulate the wires.<br> It makes it easier to align the heat shrink if you install the mating connector.*

<img src="../details/motor_connectors_4.jpg" width="300"> <br>*Finished motor phase connnectors.*

<img src="../details/motor_mod_15.jpg" width="350"> <br>*The stator is now ready for assembly.*
